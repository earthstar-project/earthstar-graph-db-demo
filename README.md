# Demo: using Earthstar Graph Database

This is a minimal working example showing how to use [`earthstar-graph-db`](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar-graph-db), which is a graph database that runs on top of [Earthstar](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar).

It's a tiny command line script that just creates a single edge, then queries to get the edge back.

### Install and run

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Read the code

See [`src/index.ts`](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar-graph-db-demo/blob/main/src/index.ts).
